                <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                <p>iTea Hub began with a simple idea — to create a space where people could pause, connect, and enjoy a good cup of tea.
                    What started as a love for tea slowly grew into a hub for conversations, creativity, and comfort.
                    Today, iTea Hub continues to brew quality teas and warm moments, bringing people together one cup at a time.</p>
